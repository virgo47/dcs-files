= Mods and OVGME

These are mods that go to the DCS installation directory.

Instead of applying them directly, use OVGME: https://wiki.hoggitworld.com/view/OVGME

1. Create a directory for mods that go to the DCS installation, e.g.:
h:\games\dcs-ovgme\dcs-install-mods\mods

2. Copy the directories from here under the `mods` directory.

3. Open OVGME, it will detect the mods in the directory.

4. Enable the mod, its content will be copied to the installation directory.

Now start the game and test it.

NOTE that some mods go to the installation directory, but others may go to `Saved Games/<dcs>`.
For these, create a separate OVGME profile with different directory, so you can switch easily.
